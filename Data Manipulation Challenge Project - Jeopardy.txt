                        JEOPARDY

GIVEN:
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', -1)
  2. We’ve provided a csv file containing data about the game show Jeopardy! in a file named jeopardy.csv. Load the data into a DataFrame and investigate its contents. Try to print out 
specific columns. Note that in order to make this project as “real-world” as possible, we haven’t modified the data at all — we’re giving it to you exactly how we found it. As a result, 
this data isn’t as “clean” as the datasets you normally find on Codecademy. More specifically, there’s something odd about the column names. After you figure out the problem with the 
column names, you may want to rename them to make your life easier the rest of the project. In order to display the full contents of a column, we’ve added this line of code to the top 
of your file:
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)
//
jeopardy = pd.read_csv('jeopardy.csv')
print(jeopardy)
print(jeopardy.columns)                                    RESULT: Index(['Show Number', ' Air Date', ' Round', ' Category', ' Value', ' Question', ' Answer'], dtype='object')
jeopardy.rename(columns=
  {'Show Number': 'Show Number',
  ' Air Date': 'Air Date',
  ' Round': 'Round',
  ' Category': 'Category',
  ' Value': 'Value',
  ' Question': 'Question',
  ' Answer': 'Answer'}, inplace = True)
print(jeopardy.columns)                                   RESULT: Index(['Show Number', 'Air Date', 'Round', 'Category', 'Value', 'Question', 'Answer'], dtype='object')
  3. Write a function that filters the dataset for questions that contains all of the words in a list of words. For example, when the list ["King", "England"] was passed to our function, 
the function returned a DataFrame of 152 rows. Every row had the strings "King" and "England" somewhere in its " Question". Note that in this example, we found 152 rows by filtering 
the entire dataset. You can download the entire dataset at the start or end of this project. The dataset used on Codecademy is only a fraction of the dataset so you won’t find as many rows.
Test your function by printing out the column containing the question of each row of the dataset.
